Node.js is a platform built on and for JavaScript, special-built to allow for the building of "fast and scalable network applications."  More specifically, Node.js allows for the use of JavaScript as a general-purpose programming language, without being constrained to a browser, by bundling Google's V8 engine with a collection of libraries to do I/O and networking. 

Importantly, Node.js is asynchrynous and event driven, meaning that a Node.js server doesn't have to wait around for data to return before moving on.  Instead, a given script will continue to run until an event is received and the server can respond accordingly.  This makes Node.js a great platform for I/O bound apps, anything that is real-time and data basied (DIRT - Data Intensive Real-time Applications), single page apps, and more.
